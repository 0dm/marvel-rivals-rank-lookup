# marvel-rivals-rank-lookup
## bronze players flamed my spiderman too much

this page lets you lookup player rank history for marvel rivals (really meant for PC but might work on console).

all data is from [tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/). if you're from the tracker network team and see this, please approve my api key and i'll stop doing this

it's kinda hacky, it opens an iframe with a bunch of json and you just have to ctrl + a and click process to paste. it's pretty quick though
